Read two inputs from the user either 0 or 1.
if the both inputs are high in logical AND operator the output will be high
else the output is zero
logic for AND=a&&b;
if any one of input are high in logical OR operator the output will be high.
Otherwise the output is zero
logic for OR=a||b 
if the input as high the output will be low in NOT gate.
logic for NOT=!a
