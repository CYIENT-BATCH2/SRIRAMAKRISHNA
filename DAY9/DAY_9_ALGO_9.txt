9.Assume that we have a car with 8 seats, and we are monitoring 8 seat belt status in a variable “G_Msg_switchstatus_Byte[]” as shown in pic1. 
Each switch status is combination of 2 bits as shown in pic2.
Write status of switches into variable “G_Msg_switchstatus_Byte[]” as below.
SWITCH1, SWITCH7 status is “faulty type 1 in switch”, SWITCH2, SWITCH5 status is ”switch unbuckle”, SWITCH3, SWITCH6 status is “switch buckle”,
SWITCH4, SWITCH0 status is “faulty type 2 in switch” without disturbing the other bits.

Algorithm:
Declare the array variable G_Msg_switchstatus_Byte[]
declare and initialize switches and status of switches
SWITCH1, SWITCH7 status is “faulty type 1 in switch”
SWITCH2, SWITCH5 status is ”switch unbuckle”
SWITCH3, SWITCH6 status is “switch buckle”
SWITCH4, SWITCH0 status is “faulty type 2 in switch”
set the switch status according to the problem
