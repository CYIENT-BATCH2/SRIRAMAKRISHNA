8. I). Write program to set (1) bits CIS, C2OUT, C1OUT in register “CMCON” if bits CHS3, CHS2, CHS1 bits are set to 0x06 in register “ADCON0”

Algorithm:
Initialize two variable ADCON0 and CMCON as a register names
read the two value for ADCON0 and CMCON as a regiter values 
check the bits CHS3,CHS2,CHS1 bit of ADCON0 register is equal to 0x06 or not
if CHS3,CHS2,CHS1 value is equal to 0x06 then set the bits CIS,C2OUT,C1OUT in register CMCON
