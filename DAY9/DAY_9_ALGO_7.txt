7. I). Set the register SSPSTAT value such a way that bit CKE, P and S bit are cleared (0), without disturbing the other bits.
II). Find out the value of UA, BF, SMP bits in SSPSTAT register if the value of the register is 0x55

Algorithm:
Declare a variable SSPSTAT as a register
read the SSPSTAT register value form user
Set the register SSPSTAT value such a way that bit CKE, P and S bit are cleared (0),without disturbing the other bits
print the register bits
if the value of register is equal to 0x55,find the value of UA, BF, SMP bits in SSPSTAT register
print the value of UA, BF, SMP bits
